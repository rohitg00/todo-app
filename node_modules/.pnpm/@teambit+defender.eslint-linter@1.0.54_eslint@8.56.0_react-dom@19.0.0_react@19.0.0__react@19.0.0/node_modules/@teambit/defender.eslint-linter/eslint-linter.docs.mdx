import { ESLintExample } from './examples';

ESlint is used as the default linter in Bit's official envs.

## Setup

If your [env](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/dev-environments) does not already use ESLint, install it in your workspace:

```
bit install @teambit/defender.eslint-linter
```

Implement the following in your env to use ESLint and configure it:

<ESLintExample />

Run the following to compile your env after making changes to your env's ESLint configuration:

```
bit compile
```

### File types

Set the `extensions` property with the list of file types to lint.
File extension that are not in this list will be ignored (even if these file types are listed in the configuration under `"overrides"`).

```json
{
  "extensions": [".ts", ".tsx", ".js", ".jsx", ".mjs"]
}
```

### eslintrc.js

The `eslintrc.js` file extends your env's default configuration, using ESLint's `"extends"` property.
The configuration added to this file will override any conflicting configuration from the (default) extended config file.

For example, the following adds the `"no-console"` rule to the [default configuration of a React env](https://bit.cloud/teambit/react/eslint-config-bit-react/~code/bit-react-eslint.js):

```js
{
  extends: [require.resolve('@teambit/react.react-env/config/eslintrc')],
  rules: {
    "no-console": "error"
  }
}
```

## tsconfig.json

The `tsconfig.json` file extends your env's default configuration, using Typescript's extends property.
If you modify your `tsconfig.json` file, make sure to [replace the Typescript configuration in your env](/typescript/typescript-config), as well.

## Plugins and shareable configurations

When using a plugin or a shareable configuration, it's important to manually set it as a dependency of that env.
This has to be done since ESLint config files do not include standard `import`/`require` statements that can be parsed by Bit's dependency resolver, and then, automatically added to the env's dependencies.

For example, let's say you have a plugin called `eslint-plugin-foo` and a shareable configuration called `eslint-config-bar`.

Run the following to install the dependencies:

```
bit install
```

Set the plugin and shareable config in you ESLint config file:

```json
{
  "extends": ["bar"],
  "plugins": ["foo"]
}
```

Make sure the plugin path property to points to the env's directory (this will allow it to resolve the dependencies from the proper location):

```ts
  linter() {
    return ESLintLinter.from({
      configPath: require.resolve('./config/eslintrc.js'),
      /* the plugin path should point to the env's directory */
      pluginsPath: __dirname,
    });
  }
```

## Change ESLint version

Run the following on a component that uses your env, to get the ESLint version currently being used:

<EnvsGet />

The out is similar to the following:

<EnvsGetOutput />

To provide your ESLint linter with a different version of ESLint,
implement the linter env handler and replace your ESLint build task:

```ts
/* @filename: my-env.bit-env.ts */

// imports...

import { ESLintLinter, EslintTask } from '@teambit/defender.eslint-linter';
import { ESLint as ESLintLib } from 'eslint';

export class MyEnv {
  linter() {
    return ESLintLinter.from({
      eslint: ESLintLib,
    });
  }

  build() {
    return super.build().replace([
      EslintTask.from({
        eslint: ESLintLib,
      }),
    ]);
  }
}

export default new MyEnv();
```

Install the version of ESLint you want to use:

```
bit install eslint
```

ESLint is automatically detected as a dependency of that env.
By default, dependencies are resolved to the ones installed in that workspace.

Run the following to compile your env:

```
bit compile
```
