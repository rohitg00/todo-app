> Prettier is a widely-used formatter in Bit's official environments, but you might need to configure it according to your specific requirements. Follow the steps below to integrate or fine-tune Prettier in your environment. If you're new to Bit environments, consider reviewing [creating your dev environment](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/dev-environments) first.

## Integrating Prettier into Your Environment

1. **Install Prettier:** If Prettier is not already in your workspace, add it.

```
bit install @teambit/defender.prettier-formatter
```

2. **Configure Prettier in Your Environment:** Implement the following configuration to integrate Prettier:

   <PrettierExample />

### Updating Prettier Version

To change the Prettier version:

1. **Check Current Prettier Version:** Run the following command on a component using your env:

```
bit update @teambit/defender.prettier-formatter
```

2. **Install the Desired Prettier Version:** Add the specific Prettier version to your workspace.


3. **Implement the Updated Formatter:** Modify your environment to use the installed Prettier instance.

```typescript
   import { ReactEnv } from '@bitdev/react.react-env';
   import { PrettierFormatter } from '@teambit/defender.prettier-formatter';
   import prettier from 'prettier';

   
   class MyEnv extends ReactEnv {
     formatter() {
       return PrettierFormatter.from({
         prettier,
       });
     }
   }

   export default new UpdatePrettierEnv();
```

   Prettier will be detected as a dependency of your environment. Dependencies are typically resolved to those installed in your workspace.

4. **Recompile Your Environment:** Compile your environment to apply the changes.

```
bit compile
```
