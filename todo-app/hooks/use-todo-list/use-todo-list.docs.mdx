A react hook for incrementing the state of count by 1 each time increment() is invoked.

## Get started

Install and use the hook in your components:

```tsx
export function MyComponent() {
  const response = useCounter();
  return <div onClick={response.increment}>The count is {response.count}</div>;
}
```
